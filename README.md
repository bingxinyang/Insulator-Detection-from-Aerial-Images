# Insulator-Detection-from-Aerial-Images

This repository contains my work as part of Study Oriented Project on detection of Insulators from aerial Images captured from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. This project was done under the guidance of Dr. Sanjay Singh Yadav, CEERI Pilani and Dr. Jennifer Ranjani, CSIS Departement, BITS Pilani.

The full scope of the project is to identify the insulators from aerial images which is tunnelled into a consecutive CNN model which identifies the errors in missing caps in insulators. I have worked towards improving the Insulator detection from the overall images.Although several methods already exist for Object detection, the main challenge in this project lies in the fact that the background could be very diverse and inconsistent, which would result inaccurate results. 

In the project above, I have implemented the Faster RCNN architecture and checked the varied results by alternating between the usage of different CNN network in the chosen architecture.
